## Introduction

The Washing Machine Controller module is implemented in Verilog and uses a finite state machine to control the various stages of a washing machine.

## Features

- State machine implementation for washing machine control.
- Support for different modes with configurable soak, wash, rinse, and spin times.
- Outputs indicating the current state of the washing machine.

## Verilog Files

- `Controller.v`: Main Verilog file containing the Washing Machine Controller module.

## Simulation

To simulate the Verilog code, you can use a Verilog simulator such as . Follow these steps:
